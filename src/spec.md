# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make area names in the Featured Properties section clickable, allowing users to navigate to filtered property listings for specific areas.

**Planned changes:**
- Convert area names (e.g., 'Gulshan', 'Banani', 'Dhanmondi') in property cards into clickable links
- Create dynamic area landing pages or filterable sections that display properties filtered by area
- Implement URL routing for area-specific views (e.g., /properties/gulshan)
- Style area name links with navy blue or gold color, underline on hover, and clear visual indicators
- Add smooth scroll behavior or page transitions when navigating between main and area-specific property views

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click on any area name in the Featured Properties section to view all properties in that specific area, with smooth navigation and clear visual feedback indicating clickable elements.
