  "summary": "The diff implements all four requirements for clickable area names with property listing navigation. Area names are converted to clickable links using TanStack Router, a dedicated PropertyListingPage component handles filtered views with URL routing support (/properties/$area), links are styled with navy blue color and hover underline from the brand palette, and smooth scroll behavior is implemented via CSS animations and useEffect hooks with 400ms transitions.",

      "reason": "BuildRequest specified 'Navigation is clear and users can easily return to the main property listing view' but did not explicitly request breadcrumb navigation or a 'Back to Home' button. This is an implementation detail that exceeds the acceptance criteria.",
